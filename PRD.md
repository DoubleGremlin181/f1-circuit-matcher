# Planning Guide

A web application that challenges users to draw shapes that match Formula 1 circuit layouts, using shape recognition algorithms to find the best matches.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Playful** - The core mechanic of drawing shapes to match race circuits creates a fun, game-like experience that rewards creativity and circuit knowledge
2. **Immediate** - Shape matching happens instantly as users complete their drawing, providing rapid feedback and encouraging multiple attempts
3. **Informative** - Each match reveals interesting facts about the circuit, turning a simple game into an educational experience about F1 history

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
  - Core drawing mechanic, shape matching algorithm, settings panel, and circuit database make this more than a micro tool, but the focused scope keeps it from being complex

## Essential Features

### Drawing Canvas
- **Functionality**: Touch and mouse-enabled drawing surface where users create closed shapes with live circuit overlay
- **Purpose**: Primary interaction mechanism that needs to feel natural on both mobile and desktop
- **Trigger**: User touches/clicks canvas and begins drawing
- **Progression**: Touch canvas → drag to draw path → release to complete shape → shape automatically closes → matching algorithm runs → matched circuit overlays on canvas
- **Success criteria**: Smooth drawing on mobile and desktop with no lag, clear visual feedback of the drawn path, semi-transparent overlay of matched circuit for comparison

### Shape Matching Engine
- **Functionality**: Compares user's drawn shape against database of F1 circuit layouts using configurable similarity algorithms with official circuit data
- **Purpose**: Core game mechanic that determines which circuit best matches the user's drawing
- **Trigger**: User completes a closed shape on canvas
- **Progression**: Shape completed → normalize both shapes → apply selected algorithm (Hausdorff distance, Frechet distance, or turning angle) → rank circuits by similarity → display top match with percentage → show circuit overlay
- **Success criteria**: Returns results within 500ms, shows match percentage, displays top match with overlay visualization

### Circuit Information Display
- **Functionality**: Shows detailed information and fun facts about matched circuits sourced from official F1 data
- **Purpose**: Educational component that rewards users with interesting F1 knowledge
- **Trigger**: Matching algorithm completes
- **Progression**: Match found → display circuit name, location, and layout → show fun facts (lap record, notable wins, unique characteristics) → display number of corners and circuit length
- **Success criteria**: Each circuit has 3-5 interesting facts from official sources, information is easily readable, accurate lap records and circuit statistics

### Dark Mode Toggle
- **Functionality**: Switches between light and dark themes with persistent preference
- **Purpose**: Provides comfortable viewing in different lighting conditions and user preference
- **Trigger**: User clicks theme toggle button
- **Progression**: Click toggle → theme switches → preference saves to localStorage → canvas colors update dynamically
- **Success criteria**: Instant theme switching, smooth color transitions, proper contrast in both modes, respects system preference on first load

### Settings Panel
- **Functionality**: Allows users to select different shape matching algorithms
- **Purpose**: Gives users control over matching sensitivity and method, enabling experimentation
- **Trigger**: User clicks settings icon
- **Progression**: Click settings → drawer/dialog opens → select algorithm (Hausdorff/Frechet/Turning Angle) → selection saves automatically → close panel
- **Success criteria**: Settings persist between sessions, clear explanation of each algorithm's characteristics

### Clear/Reset Function
- **Functionality**: Clears the canvas and overlay to start a new drawing
- **Purpose**: Allows users to quickly try again without page reload
- **Trigger**: User clicks clear button
- **Progression**: Click clear → canvas resets → overlay clears → previous results fade out → ready for new drawing
- **Success criteria**: Instant canvas clear, smooth transition

## Edge Case Handling

- **Incomplete shapes**: If user draws a line that doesn't close, automatically connect endpoints when they lift finger/mouse
- **Tiny drawings**: Reject shapes smaller than minimum threshold with helpful tooltip
- **Scribbles**: Very chaotic drawings still produce a match but may show low confidence percentage
- **No match found**: Show "No close match" message with encouragement to try again
- **Touch palm rejection**: Prevent accidental touches from registering as drawing input
- **Rapid redrawing**: Debounce matching algorithm to prevent performance issues

## Design Direction

The design should feel playful yet sophisticated, like a racing simulation meets a creative toy. A minimal, focused interface that puts the drawing canvas front and center, with racing-inspired accent colors that evoke the speed and precision of Formula 1 without becoming overwhelming or garish.

## Color Selection

Analogous scheme using racing-inspired reds and oranges with neutral grays for a focused, energetic feel, with full dark mode support

- **Primary Color**: Racing Red (oklch(0.55 0.22 25)) - Communicates F1's iconic Ferrari red, energy, and competition
- **Secondary Colors**: Charcoal Gray (oklch(0.25 0.01 270)) for backgrounds and Carbon Fiber Gray (oklch(0.35 0.01 270)) for secondary elements, evoking the technical precision of F1
- **Accent Color**: Bright Orange (oklch(0.70 0.18 45)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs and match results
- **Foreground/Background Pairings (Light Mode)**:
  - Background (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0 0)): Charcoal text (oklch(0.20 0.01 270)) - Ratio 13.2:1 ✓
